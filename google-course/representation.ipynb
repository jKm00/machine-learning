    "## Mapping Raw Data to Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature engineering** means transforming raw data into feature vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mapping numeric values\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer and floating points can just be directly mapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mapping categorical values\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical features like `street_name` can only be a discrete set of possible values. We need to map them into numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Street names:**  \n",
    "{'Charleston Road', 'North Shoreline Boulevard', 'Shorebird Way', 'Rengstorff Avenue'}\n",
    "\n",
    "We map:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Charleston Road -> 0\n",
    "- North shoreline Boulevard -> 1\n",
    "- Shorebird Way -> 2\n",
    "- Rengstorff Avenue ->\n",
    "- Everyting else (OOV) -> 4\n",
    "\n",
    "_OOV: out-of-vocabulary, where the vocabulary is every possible value for the category_\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some problems with this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unlikely that there is a linear adjustment between the feature `street_name` and the output\n",
    "2. Some houses might have multiple street names (houses at a corner of a street)\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, we can create a binary vector instead (called **one-hot encoding**):\n",
    "\n",
    "- For values that apply to the example, set corresponding vector elements to `1`\n",
    "- Set all other elements to `0`\n",
    "\n",
    "_Lenght of this vector is the same as the number of elements in the vocabulary_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Side Note: Spares Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you had 1,000,000 different street names in your data set. Createing a vector with 1,000,000 elements would be inefficient. Therefore we can use **sparese representation** which only stores non-zero values"
